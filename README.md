# NYC_Taxi_Trip_Prediction
Complete EDA and Regression Models on NYC Taxi trip data
------------------------------------------------------------------
The taxi trip data provided by leading taxi providers in NYC
which are NYC Taxi, Limousine Commission which as more than 1.4
million records of taxi trips in the NYC for the year 2016. The
following data which includes geometric locations of both pickup
and drop. By analysing the provided data and predict the
estimated time taken for each trip.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The taxi trip data has been successfully visualized and analyzed on top of that we also
added few machine learning models on the dataset after carefully fine tuning it. The
models we have applied are Linear Regression, Decision trees, Random forests and their
respective boosting methods such as Gradient Boosting, ADA Boosting and XG boosting.
